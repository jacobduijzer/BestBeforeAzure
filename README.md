# Best Before Application

As I have multiple members in my household with the celiac disease we have an extended stock of gluten free products. Because we often buy in bulk we have to be careful not to let products expire. The "Best Before" application is a website to manage products and stock, it will send (e-mail) about about to expire stock. Go to the [wiki](https://github.com/jacobduijzer/BestBeforeAzure/wiki) for more information.
